in API handlers:
if endpoint is declared as secure and (user != nil && token == nil) is not satisfied the handler must abort with payload.AccessDenied
if endpoint requires file and no file is uploaded the handler must abort with payload.FileRequired
if endpoint requires credential and user is nil the handler must abort with payload.CredentialRequired
if endpoint has kind defined and access token is not nil and permission does not include kind the handler must abort with payload.AppLackingPermission
if endpoint requires credential and has limit defined and the user is not admin and not moderator the handler must handle rate limiting // TODO: handle this in the wrapper
and finally, I do not understand when payload.NoSuchEndpoint is returned, if any of you know please fix it or tell me

more information will be added as we reach deeper into the original codebase
good luck, and thanks for working on this mess with me
