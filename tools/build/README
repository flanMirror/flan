every tool found in this directory has to be ran under the root of the worktree

before running these, please make sure you have have the following installed on your system:
- Go compiler at least version go1.18
- postgresql server
- postgresql client
before running assets.sh, make sure to compile the program first and have it available in the build directory

to build this from a fresh worktree, run these in this exact order:
- gen-orm.sh
- build.sh
- assets-download.sh || assets.sh [misskey_root]
- build.sh

the scripts were written for FreeBSD's sh, without using any features not available in the POSIX.1 specification, therefore these scripts should be ran on a sane, POSIX-compliant shell
